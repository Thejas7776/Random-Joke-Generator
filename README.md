# Random-Joke-Generator
HTML creates the page structure with a place to display the joke and a button. CSS styles the layout and visuals, making it attractive and user-friendly. JavaScript adds the functionality by randomly selecting and displaying jokes from a list or API whenever the button is pressed This project is a fun way to practice frontend web development skills
